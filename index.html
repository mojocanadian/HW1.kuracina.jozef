		<h2>A Brief History</h2>
		<p>My name is Jozef. I was named after my paternal grandfather. He was born in the former Czechoslovakia, which explains the spelling. I was born in the current Canada, which explains nothing. Three months after my birth, which was in February of 1984, by-the-by, my grandfather's blood-pumper suffered a catastrophic malfunction. After that, I was the only Jozef Kuracina left on Earth. So it goes.<br><br>

I’m from Victoria/Vancouver/Kelowna, B.C. and relocated to London last fall. I definitely miss the landscape of my home province. Some of my main interests/pastimes are backcountry camping, hiking, wildlife photography, and trail running. I've been doing my best to seek out green space in and around London, but it's just not the same. On the bright side: less distraction means more time to focus on my studies!<br><br>

Music, literature, languages and visual art are also major interests of mine. If I'm not outdoors you can probably find me listening to music, playing guitar, reading, writing, or making something. Yes, nature and the arts- that’s all I need!<br><br>

I think the world is a curious and wonderful place, and I have one life to explore, experience and learn as much as I can. I love to travel (I've lived in six different countries and visited around 15-20) and collect interesting experiences or skills along the way. I'm really excited to have all the skills that I'll possess at the conclusion of the Interactive Media Design program.
